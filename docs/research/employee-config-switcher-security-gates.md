# Employee config switcher write-safety gates

Status: development preview, writes disabled.

The Tauri command surface may detect clients and discover the authenticated
server configuration. `apply_configuration` must continue to fail closed until
all gates below have implementation and fault-injection evidence on each target
platform.

1. Private staging, backup and final-file permissions. Windows uses a protected
   user-only DACL and preserves the existing target security descriptor when
   replacing a file; new files receive the protected DACL before publication.
2. No durable plaintext-key backups. Rollback material is OS-encrypted or is
   removed immediately after durable completion, with a scan proving the old Key
   is absent.
3. Publication is journaled before post-write verification so a verification
   failure always has a rollback target.
4. Rollback compares the current digest and stable file identity with the bytes
   published by this operation. External edits produce a recovery conflict and
   are never overwritten or deleted.
5. Native handle-based path-chain validation rejects symlinks, reparse points,
   junction escapes and file-identity changes for target, staging, backup and
   journal paths.
6. A flushed, durable `planned -> published -> verified -> complete` journal
   supports startup recovery. A corrupt journal blocks new writes; completion is
   manifest-last and stale temporary material is cleaned without deleting
   unrelated files.
7. Format-specific strict validation rejects duplicate or ambiguous TOML, YAML,
   dotenv and JSON/JSONC definitions before any publication.
8. Existing `cpa-cloud` entries require an ownership record whose digest matches
   the live entry. Missing, corrupt or mismatched ownership fails closed.

The current OpenCode planner implements gate 8 at planning time and preserves
JSONC source through the fixed CC Switch parser. It does not publish bytes.
